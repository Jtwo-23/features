# Commitizen CLI (via npm) (cz-cli)

Commitizen is release management tool designed for teams. Commitizen assumes your team uses a standard way of commiting rules and from that foundation, it can bump your project's version, create the changelog, and update files.

## Example DevContainer Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers-contrib/features/cz-cli:1": {}
}
```
