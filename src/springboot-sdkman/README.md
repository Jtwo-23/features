# Spring Boot (via SDKMAN) (springboot-sdkman)

Spring Boot takes an opinionated view of building production-ready Spring
applications. It favors convention over configuration and is designed to get you
up and running as quickly as possible.

## Example DevContainer Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers-contrib/features/springboot-sdkman:2": {}
}
```
