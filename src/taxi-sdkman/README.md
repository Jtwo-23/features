# Taxi (via SDKMAN) (taxi-sdkman)

Taxi is a language for documenting data - such as data models - and the
contracts of APIs. It describes data semantically, allowing powerful tooling to
discover and map data based on it's meaning, rather than the name of a field.

## Example DevContainer Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers-contrib/features/taxi-sdkman:2": {}
}
```
