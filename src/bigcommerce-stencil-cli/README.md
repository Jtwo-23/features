Stencil CLI gives developers the power to locally edit and preview themes with no impact to a merchantâ€™s live storefront, and it's built-in Browsersync(opens in a new tab) capabilities make simultaneous testing across desktop, mobile, and tablet devices a breeze. Once work is complete, developers can push themes to BigCommerce storefronts (and set them live) using Stencil CLI's simple, yet powerful commands.
