# Bower (via npm) (bower)

Bower offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack.

## Example DevContainer Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers-contrib/features/bower:1": {}
}
```
