# dua (Disk Usage Analyzer) (via Github Releases) (dua)

dua (Disk Usage Analyzer) is a tool to conveniently learn about the usage of disk space of a given directory. It's parallel by default and will max out your SSD, providing relevant information as fast as possible. Optionally delete superfluous data, and do so more quickly than rm.

## Example DevContainer Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers-contrib/features/dua:1": {}
}
```
