# tmux (via apt-get) (tmux-apt-get)

tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.

## Example DevContainer Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers-contrib/features/tmux-apt-get:1": {}
}
```
